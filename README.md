# fslay

The sm_slay command in SourceMod will cause a Dystopia server to crash in my experience. This plugin was written to replace it. Also, if anyone could give some insight as to why sm_slay will cause a Dystopia server to crash, I would really appreciate it.

The following command requires the "slay" admin flag to use:
```
fslay <#userid|name>
```

It can also be integrated into the admin menu without much difficulty.
